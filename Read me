# PLS Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. The script generates synthetic data, trains a PLS regression model, and visualizes the results using scatter plots.

## Features

- Simulates synthetic data with linear relationships.
- Trains a PLS regression model using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualizes PLS scores and correlations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
